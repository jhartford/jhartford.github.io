I work on building the tools to enable scientific discovery from complex, high-dimensional data. Most of my current research focuses on developing new techniques for causal representation learning and causal inference, as well as active learning techniques for designing experiments to learn causal models. Before starting at Valence and Manchester, I completed a post-doc with <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org">Yoshua Bengio</a> at Université de Montréal, and before that, I completed my PhD at the University of British Columbia with <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kevinlb/">Kevin Leyton-Brown</a>.
