I will present my work on machine learning for causal inference at the Wits Brown Bag Lunch Seminar Series on 9 October 2025. I will give an overview of machine learning perspectives on causal inference and share examples from my recent work on deep learning for nonparametric IV regression and representation learning for unstructured data such as images and text.
