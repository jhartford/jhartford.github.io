We had two papers in the main conference (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19985">Targeted Sequential Indirect Experiment Design</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01595">Propensity Score Alignment of Unpaired Multimodal Data</a>) and three in the workshops (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02572">foundation models</a>, <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=jYl7kM1oK0">mechanistic interpretability</a>, and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=kaIkk7yN3z">score-based interaction testing</a>) at NeurIPS 2024!
